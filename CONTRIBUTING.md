# Contributing to Beacon

Thank you for your interest in Beacon! We're building this project in the open using a deliberate, spec-driven approach.

## Current Phase: Specification & Planning

Beacon is currently in the **specification phase**. We're designing the architecture and planning the implementation before writing code.

### How You Can Help Right Now

1. **Review Specifications** - Read proposed specs in the `.specify/` directory and provide feedback
2. **RFC Expertise** - If you have deep knowledge of RFC 6762 or RFC 6763, your input is invaluable
3. **Use Case Discussions** - Share your real-world service discovery needs and challenges
4. **Design Feedback** - Participate in architectural discussions and design reviews

### Communication

- **GitHub Discussions** - For questions, ideas, and general discussion
- **GitHub Issues** - For tracking specific spec items, decisions, and tasks
- **Pull Requests** - For proposing changes to specifications (not code yet)

## Our Process

Beacon follows a **spec-driven development** approach:

1. **Specification** - Every feature starts with a detailed specification
2. **Review** - Specifications are reviewed and refined through discussion
3. **Approval** - Specs are approved before implementation begins
4. **Test-Driven Development** - Implementation follows RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
5. **Documentation** - Features are documented as they're implemented

## Code Contributions (Future)

We're not accepting code contributions yet, but when we are:

- All code must have corresponding tests
- All code must implement an approved specification
- Follow the TDD cycle: write failing tests, make them pass, refactor
- Code must pass all CI checks and maintain RFC compliance

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and collaborative. We're all here to build something excellent together.

## Questions?

If you're unsure how to contribute or have questions, open a GitHub Discussion. We're happy to help!
