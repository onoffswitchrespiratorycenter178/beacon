2. **Spec-Driven Development** - All features designed through GitHub Spec Kit specifications
3. **Test-Driven Development** - RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle for all code
4. **Phased Approach** - Deliberate, well-planned incremental delivery
5. **Open Source** - Transparent development, welcoming contributions
6. **Maintained** - Long-term commitment to support and evolution
7. **Excellence** - Continuous improvement toward best-in-class implementation

## Non-Negotiables

- No feature without a specification
- No code without tests
- No compromise on RFC compliance
- No release without documentation
