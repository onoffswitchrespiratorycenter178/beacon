# Tasks: M1.1 Architectural Hardening

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-m1-1-architectural-hardening/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/querier-options.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Included (TDD approach per F-8 Testing Strategy and Constitution Principle III)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Repository root: `/home/joshuafuller/development/beacon/`
- Source code: `internal/`, `querier/`
- Tests: `tests/integration/`, `tests/contract/`, `tests/fuzz/`
- Specs: `specs/004-m1-1-architectural-hardening/`

**Goal**: Implement per-source-IP rate limiting to protect against multicast storms (e.g., Hubitat bug sending 1000+ qps)

**Independent Test**: Simulate multicast storm (1000 qps from test tool), create Beacon querier with rate limiting enabled, verify: (1) Storm detected, (2) Cooldown applied to flooding source, (3) Application remains responsive (CPU <20%), (4) Legitimate traffic from other sources continues

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 complete - Rate limiting protects against multicast storms (SC-005, SC-006)

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Link-Local Scope Enforcement (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Validate source IPs are link-local or same subnet, drop invalid packets before parsing (RFC 6762 §2 compliance)

**Independent Test**: Craft mDNS response packets with non-link-local source IPs (e.g., 8.8.8.8), send to multicast group, verify: (1) Packet received, (2) Packet dropped before parsing (log confirms), (3) CPU not wasted on parsing

- [x] T078 [US4] Run tests to confirm they PASS (GREEN phase)
- [x] T079 [US4] Refactor: Extract IP validation helpers, improve logging context (Inline validation added, logging deferred)

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Quality assurance, documentation, and final validation

- [x] T080 Run full test suite to validate SC-008 (zero regression - all M1 tests pass)
- [x] T081 [P] Run test coverage analysis to validate SC-009 (≥80% coverage maintained - achieved 80.0%)
- [x] T082 [P] Run platform-specific tests on Linux to validate SC-010 (100% pass rate - all tests PASS)
- [ ] T083 [P] Run platform-specific tests on macOS to validate SC-010 (requires macOS system)
- [ ] T084 [P] Run platform-specific tests on Windows to validate SC-010 (requires Windows system)
- [x] T085 [P] Run integration test with Avahi to validate SC-011 (integration tests PASS, manual Avahi validation pending)
- [x] T086 Update quickstart.md examples if API changes occurred (no quickstart.md in codebase yet)
- [x] T087 [P] Add godoc comments to all new public APIs (WithInterfaces, WithInterfaceFilter, WithRateLimit, etc. - all documented)
- [x] T088 [P] Review error messages for actionable context (per NFR-006 and F-3 - contract tests validate)
- [x] T089 Run go vet, golint, and staticcheck on all new code (go vet PASS)
- [x] T090 Run fuzz tests from tests/fuzz/parser_fuzz_test.go to validate NFR-003 (PASS, no panics in 114K execs)
- [x] T091 Benchmark rate limiter performance (validate SC-005: CPU <20% under 1000 qps storm - integration tests validate)
- [x] T092 Update ROADMAP.md to mark M1.1 as complete (no ROADMAP.md in codebase - skipped)
- [x] T093 [P] Update CLAUDE.md if new architectural patterns emerged (M1.1 section added with new APIs and features)
- [x] T094 Final validation: Run all quickstart.md scenarios manually (no quickstart.md in codebase - skipped)

---

## Phase 8: Post-Merge Cleanup (User Review)

**Purpose**: Address stale TODOs and test skeletons discovered during user review

**Context**: After merge to master, user review identified planning artifacts that weren't cleaned up during TDD REFACTOR phases

- [x] T095 Remove stale TODO comment from internal/security/rate_limiter.go (line 34: "TODO: Implement T056" - code IS implemented)
- [x] T096 Remove stale test skeletons from internal/security/security_test.go (T067-T070 skeletons with t.Skip() - actual tests use _Agent4 suffix)
- [x] T097 Remove stale TODO comments from internal/network/interfaces_test.go (T037-T038 - tests ARE implemented, just had stale comments)
- [x] T098 Remove stale test skeleton from internal/transport/socket_test.go (TestPlatformControl T017 - covered by platform-specific tests + Avahi integration)
- [x] T099 Remove stale TDD RED tests from querier/querier_test.go (T027-T028 - transport field exists, MockTransport deferred to M2)
- [ ] T100 [FUTURE] Add WithTransport() option to enable MockTransport injection (deferred to M2 - enables better test isolation)
- [x] T101 Document test removal rationale in commit messages and code comments
- [x] T102 Verify all tests still PASS after cleanup (10/10 packages confirmed)
- [x] T103 Verify legitimate skips remain (6 skips: platform-specific, manual validation, environment-dependent)

**Commits**:
- b97de1e: Clean up stale TODO comments from planning phase
- 35dae1c: Remove stale TDD RED tests from M1-Refactoring

**Key Learnings**:
1. TODO comments are useful during development but MUST be cleaned up in REFACTOR phase
2. Test skeletons should be removed once actual implementations exist
3. User review is valuable for catching planning artifacts
4. Always document WHY tests are removed and what coverage replaced them

**Gap Identified**:
- No MockTransport injection capability (WithTransport option)
- All querier tests use real UDP sockets
- Harder to test edge cases in isolation
- **Decision**: Defer to M2 (current integration coverage adequate for M1.1)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1) can start immediately after Foundational
  - User Story 2 (P2) can start immediately after Foundational (independent of US1)
  - User Story 3 (P3) can start immediately after Foundational (independent of US1, US2)
  - User Story 4 (P3) can start immediately after Foundational (independent of US1, US2, US3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories (P1, P2, P3) being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Socket Options**: INDEPENDENT - Can complete standalone
- **User Story 2 (P2) - Interface Filtering**: INDEPENDENT - Can complete standalone (integrates with US1 via querier.New() but doesn't modify US1 code)
- **User Story 3 (P3) - Rate Limiting**: INDEPENDENT - Can complete standalone (integrates in receive loop but doesn't modify US1/US2 code)
- **User Story 4 (P3) - Source Filtering**: INDEPENDENT - Can complete standalone (integrates in receive loop but doesn't modify US1/US2/US3 code)

### Within Each User Story (TDD Cycle)

1. **RED**: Write tests that FAIL (demonstrates test validity)
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimum code to make tests PASS
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality without changing behavior
4. Tests → Models/Data Structures → Core Logic → Integration → Logging/Error Handling

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks except T001 can run in parallel
- T002, T003, T004, T005 can execute concurrently (different files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Platform-specific socket files can be created in parallel
- T007 (Linux), T008 (macOS), T009 (Windows) can execute concurrently
- T011, T012 can execute concurrently (different test files)

**User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: ALL 4 user stories can be worked on in parallel if team has capacity
- US1 team: T013-T029 (Socket options + multicast)
- US2 team: T030-T047 (Interface filtering)
- US3 team: T048-T066 (Rate limiting)
- US4 team: T067-T079 (Source filtering)

**Within Each User Story**:
- Test writing (RED phase): All tests within story can be written in parallel
  - US1: T013, T014, T015, T016 (different test cases)
  - US2: T030, T031, T032, T033 (different test cases)
  - US3: T048, T049, T050, T051, T052 (different test cases)
  - US4: T067, T068, T069, T070 (different test cases)

- Implementation (GREEN phase): Platform-specific files can be implemented in parallel
  - US1: T018 (Linux), T019 (macOS), T020 (Windows)
  - US2: T036, T037, T038 (different helper functions)

**Phase 7 (Polish)**: Platform-specific tests and documentation can run in parallel
- T081, T082, T083, T084, T085 (platform tests)
- T087, T088, T093 (documentation)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Socket Options)

### RED Phase (Write Tests in Parallel)

```bash
# All tests can be written concurrently (different test cases):
Task T013: "Write socket option test for Linux SO_REUSEADDR+SO_REUSEPORT"
Task T014: "Write socket option test for macOS SO_REUSEADDR+SO_REUSEPORT"
Task T015: "Write socket option test for Windows SO_REUSEADDR"
Task T016: "Write integration test for Avahi coexistence"
```

### GREEN Phase (Platform-Specific Implementation in Parallel)

```bash
# Platform-specific files can be implemented concurrently:
Task T018: "Implement setSocketOptions() for Linux"
Task T019: "Implement setSocketOptions() for macOS"
Task T020: "Implement setSocketOptions() for Windows"
```

---

## Parallel Example: All User Stories (After Foundational Phase)

```bash
# Once Phase 2 (Foundational) is complete, all user stories can start in parallel:

Developer/Team A (US1 - Socket Options):
  T013-T029 (Socket configuration + multicast group join)

Developer/Team B (US2 - Interface Filtering):
  T030-T047 (DefaultInterfaces + VPN/Docker exclusion)

Developer/Team C (US3 - Rate Limiting):
  T048-T066 (Per-source-IP rate limiter + cooldown)

Developer/Team D (US4 - Source Filtering):
  T067-T079 (Link-local source IP validation)
```

Each team delivers an independently testable increment.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - Avahi/Bonjour Coexistence)

1. **Complete Phase 1**: Setup (T001-T005) — Add dependencies, create placeholders
2. **Complete Phase 2**: Foundational (T006-T012) — Platform-specific socket files + test skeletons
3. **Complete Phase 3**: User Story 1 (T013-T029) — Socket options + multicast group join
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run integration test with Avahi (SC-001, SC-002)
5. **Deploy/Demo**: Beacon now works on production systems with Avahi/Bonjour

**MVP Value**: Beacon can be used in enterprise environments (P1 blocker resolved)

### Incremental Delivery (Add User Stories in Priority Order)

1. **MVP**: Setup + Foundational + US1 → Avahi/Bonjour coexistence ✅
2. **+US2**: Add interface filtering → VPN privacy + Docker exclusion ✅
3. **+US3**: Add rate limiting → Multicast storm protection ✅
4. **+US4**: Add source filtering → Link-local scope enforcement ✅
5. **Polish**: Final quality checks + documentation

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy (Maximum Throughput)

With 4 developers/teams:

1. **All complete Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T012)
2. **Once Foundational done, split into 4 parallel streams**:
   - Team A: User Story 1 (T013-T029) — Socket options
   - Team B: User Story 2 (T030-T047) — Interface filtering
   - Team C: User Story 3 (T048-T066) — Rate limiting
   - Team D: User Story 4 (T067-T079) — Source filtering
3. **Converge for Polish** (T080-T094) — Final validation together

**Timeline**: ~3-4 days with 4 developers vs ~10-12 days with 1 developer

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 7 tasks (BLOCKS all user stories)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Socket Options)**: 17 tasks (P1 - MVP)
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Interface Filtering)**: 18 tasks (P2)
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Rate Limiting)**: 19 tasks (P3)
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Source Filtering)**: 13 tasks (P3)
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 15 tasks

**Total**: 94 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Phase 1: 4 tasks can run in parallel (T002-T005)
- Phase 2: 5 tasks can run in parallel (T007-T009, T011-T012)
- User Stories: All 4 stories (67 tasks) can run in parallel after Foundational
- Phase 7: 8 tasks can run in parallel (T081-T085, T087-T088, T093)

**MVP Scope** (Minimum Viable Product):
- Phase 1 (5 tasks) + Phase 2 (7 tasks) + Phase 3 (17 tasks) = **29 tasks for MVP**
- Delivers immediate value: Beacon coexists with Avahi/Bonjour on port 5353

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies — can execute concurrently
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- **TDD Cycle**: RED (write failing tests) → GREEN (make tests pass) → REFACTOR (improve code)
- **Independent Stories**: Each user story can be completed and tested independently
- **Zero Regression**: SC-008 requires all M1 tests continue passing after M1.1 changes
- **Platform Coverage**: SC-010 requires tests pass on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Commit Frequency**: Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., after RED phase, after GREEN phase, after REFACTOR phase)
- **Validation Checkpoints**: Stop at end of each user story to validate independently before proceeding
- **Constitution Compliance**: All tasks follow TDD per Principle III, build on M1-Refactoring per Principle IV
