# M1.1 Incomplete Tasks Analysis

**Date**: 2025-11-02
**Status**: 3 tasks incomplete out of 103 total
**Context**: Post-merge validation per user request

---

## Summary

M1.1 has **3 unchecked tasks** (T083, T084, T100):
- **2 tasks blocked** by platform availability (T083, T084)
- **1 task deferred** by design to M2 (T100)

**Impact on Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **6 of 7 success criteria fully met** (SC-001 through SC-007, SC-009)
- ⚠️ **1 success criterion partially met**: SC-010 (Linux ✅, macOS ⚠️, Windows ⚠️)

---

## Incomplete Tasks Detail

### T083: macOS Platform Tests (BLOCKED)

**Status**: ⚠️ Blocked - Requires macOS hardware
**Task**: "Run platform-specific tests on macOS to validate SC-010 (requires macOS system)"
**Maps to**: SC-010 (Platform-specific socket option tests pass)

**What it validates**:
- `internal/transport/socket_darwin.go` SO_REUSEADDR + SO_REUSEPORT
- Bonjour coexistence on macOS
- Multicast socket options work correctly on macOS

**Why blocked**:
- Development environment is Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)
- No macOS CI/CD pipeline configured
- SC-010 explicitly requires "on each platform in CI"

**Next steps**:
1. **Option A (CI/CD)**: Set up GitHub Actions with macOS runner
   - Add `.github/workflows/test-macos.yml`
   - Run `go test ./internal/transport -tags darwin`
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

2. **Option B (Manual)**: Request manual testing on macOS hardware
   - Document manual test procedure
   - Requires contributor with macOS access
   - Higher risk, no automation

**Recommendation**: Defer to **M1.2 or M2** as part of CI/CD infrastructure setup

---

### T084: Windows Platform Tests (BLOCKED)

**Status**: ⚠️ Blocked - Requires Windows hardware
**Task**: "Run platform-specific tests on Windows to validate SC-010 (requires Windows system)"
**Maps to**: SC-010 (Platform-specific socket option tests pass)

**What it validates**:
- `internal/transport/socket_windows.go` SO_REUSEADDR (no SO_REUSEPORT)
- Windows socket API compatibility
- Multicast socket options work correctly on Windows

**Why blocked**:
- Development environment is Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)
- No Windows CI/CD pipeline configured
- SC-010 explicitly requires "on each platform in CI"

**Next steps**:
1. **Option A (CI/CD)**: Set up GitHub Actions with Windows runner
   - Add `.github/workflows/test-windows.yml`
   - Run `go test ./internal/transport -tags windows`
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

2. **Option B (Manual)**: Request manual testing on Windows hardware
   - Document manual test procedure
   - Requires contributor with Windows access
   - Higher risk, no automation

**Recommendation**: Defer to **M1.2 or M2** as part of CI/CD infrastructure setup

---

### T100: WithTransport() Option (DEFERRED BY DESIGN)

**Status**: ✅ Deferred to M2 (intentional)
**Task**: "Add WithTransport() option to enable MockTransport injection (deferred to M2)"
**Maps to**: Enhancement (not part of M1.1 success criteria)

**What it enables**:
- Inject `MockTransport` into querier for unit testing
- Test edge cases without real network
- Faster test execution
- Better test isolation

**Why deferred**:
- Not required for M1.1 success criteria
- Current integration test coverage adequate
- M2 will need this for responder testing
- TODO comments added to code (querier/options.go:176, querier_test.go:209)

**Next steps**:
1. Implement in **M2** when building responder functionality
2. Follow implementation example in TODO comments
3. Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

**Recommendation**: Keep deferred to M2, no action needed for M1.1

## Success Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| SC-M1.1-001: Avahi coexistence | ✅ Met | Integration tests pass, no port conflicts |
| SC-M1.1-002: VPN exclusion | ✅ Met | DefaultInterfaces() excludes VPN patterns |
| SC-M1.1-003: Source IP filtering | ✅ Met | Link-local validation in receive loop |
| SC-M1.1-004: Rate limiting | ✅ Met | Storm tests pass, CPU <20% under load |
| SC-M1.1-005: Zero regression | ✅ Met | All M1 tests pass (10/10 packages) |
| SC-M1.1-006: Platform tests | ⚠️ **Partial** | Linux ✅, macOS ⚠️, Windows ⚠️ |
| SC-M1.1-007: Coverage ≥80% | ✅ Met | 80.0% coverage maintained |

**Overall**: **6 of 7 criteria fully met**, 1 criterion partially met (SC-006)

## Impact Assessment

### Can we ship M1.1?

**YES** - M1.1 is production-ready with caveats:

**Strengths**:
- ✅ All critical functionality implemented (socket config, interface management, security)
- ✅ Zero regressions (all M1 tests pass)
- ✅ 80% test coverage on Linux
- ✅ Coexists with Avahi on Linux
- ✅ VPN/Docker privacy protection working
- ✅ Rate limiting and source filtering working

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ macOS platform tests not run (code exists, untested)
- ⚠️ Windows platform tests not run (code exists, untested)
- ⚠️ No CI/CD automation (manual testing only)

**Risk Level**: **LOW-MEDIUM**
- Low risk: Platform-specific code is straightforward (socket options)
- Low risk: Build tags ensure Linux code doesn't affect macOS/Windows
- Medium risk: macOS/Windows users may encounter issues we haven't tested
- Mitigation: Document "Linux-tested only" in README, encourage platform testing

---

## Recommendations

### For M1.1 Completion

**Accept current state** with documentation:
1. Update ROADMAP.md to note "Linux-tested, macOS/Windows untested"
2. Add platform testing status to README.md
3. Mark SC-010 as "Partially met (Linux only)"
4. Document T083, T084 as blocked, not skipped

### For Future Milestones

**M1.2 or M2**: Set up cross-platform CI/CD
1. Add GitHub Actions workflows for macOS and Windows
2. Run full test suite on all 3 platforms
3. Complete T083, T084
4. Achieve full SC-010 compliance
5. Implement T100 (WithTransport) when building responder

**Estimated effort**: 4-6 hours for CI/CD setup

---

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. **ROADMAP.md**:
   - Mark M1.1 as "Complete (Linux)" instead of "Complete"
   - Note SC-010 as partially met
   - Document T083, T084 as deferred to CI/CD milestone

2. **README.md** (if exists):
   - Add "Platform Support" section
   - Note: "Fully tested on Linux, code exists for macOS/Windows"
   - Encourage community testing on macOS/Windows

3. **specs/004-m1-1-architectural-hardening/tasks.md**:
   - Already documents T083, T084 as requiring platform access ✅
   - Already marks T100 as [FUTURE] ✅
   - No changes needed

4. **specs/004-m1-1-architectural-hardening/spec.md**:
   - Update SC-010 status to "Partially met (Linux only)"
   - Document need for CI/CD infrastructure

---

## Conclusion

**M1.1 is functionally complete** but lacks cross-platform validation due to platform availability constraints.

**Decision needed**:
- Ship as "Linux-tested" with documentation?
- OR defer M1.1 "Complete" status until CI/CD setup?

**My recommendation**: Ship as complete with "Linux-tested" caveat, defer cross-platform CI/CD to separate infrastructure milestone (M1.2 or as part of M5 Platform Expansion).

**Rationale**:
- All code is written (socket_darwin.go, socket_windows.go exist)
- Platform-specific code is simple and well-documented
- No known issues on macOS/Windows (code follows platform best practices)
- SC-010 partially met is better than delaying M1.1 for CI/CD infrastructure
- M5 already planned for "Platform Expansion" - natural fit for full platform validation
